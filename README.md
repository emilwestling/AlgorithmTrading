# Quantitative Finance Repository
Welcome to the Quantitative Finance Repository! This repository contains projects related to algorithmic trading and options valuation. This repository has served as my introduction to quantitative finance. I have learned so much from it! Additionally, I have two long papers I will upload to this page soon.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

## Algorithmic Trading
This folder contains notebooks related to algorithmic trading strategies and datasets with sentiment data. We explore various investment approaches, analyze market data, and implement trading algorithms.
#### Key projects:
##### LSTM Portfolio: Builds a portfolio out of the S&P 500 using LSTM deep-learning models. 
##### Autoregressive Stock Prediction: Uses autoregressive models to predict stock prices looking at historical pricing data along with various exogenous variables. Here's a link to an interactive plot of the results: [Plot](https://www.emilwestling.com/QuantitativeFinance/AlgorithmTrading/plot.html)
## Options Valuation
In this folder, we delve into options pricing models and valuation techniques. Specifically, we examine the Black-Scholes equation and solve it using numerical analysis.
#### Key topics:
##### Black-Scholes Model: Understand the classic options pricing model and its assumptions.
